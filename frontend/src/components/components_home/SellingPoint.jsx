            <b>I’m a NASM-certified personal trainer </b>with over three and a half years of intense training, dieting, and consistency.
             Before I started coaching online, I worked as an in-person trainer. 
             Once I realized I could reach and help more people through online coaching, I made the transition.
              Since then, I’ve helped over 30 clients achieve their fitness goals.
